# SolidityLearning
a repo where I add all the small code I did to learn a bit of solidity

## Simple storage [cyfrin][Remix]
Learn fundamentals of solidity with a 'simple storage' code.

## Storage factory [cyfrin][Remix]
Continue learning fundamentals of solidity (solidity imports, inheritance, interactions between contracts, ...)

## Fund me [cyfrin][Remix]
Continue to learn the basic by doing a small fake crowdfunding project. (simplified compared to cyfrin course, removed the oracle logic, ...)
